# Devs-Navbar-Try-out

## Introduction

Created the Responsive Navigation Bar of a Dribble design posted by the UI8 product design team.

Devs, check it out!

I built it with pure HTML and CSS and a litte bit of media queries, so it'll look different if viewed on a phone, try using Desktop/Laptop to view, this will give a better and different perspective, so let's compare it with Dearie's version with tailwind and Princewill's version with bootstrap.
